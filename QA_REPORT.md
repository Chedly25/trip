## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 🔴 **Backend Dependency Issues (CRITICAL)**

**Issue**: Missing `structlog` dependency blocks core services
**Impact**: HIGH - Prevents city service, ML recommendations, and data integrity testing
**Affected Components**:
- City Service (cannot find/load cities)
- ML Recommendation Engine (cannot generate suggestions)
- Data integrity validation

**Root Cause**: 
```python
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'structlog'
```

**Fix Required**:
```bash
pip install structlog
# OR add to requirements.txt:
structlog>=23.1.0
```

### 🔴 **Frontend Integration Issues**

**Issue**: JavaScript features may not connect to backend properly due to missing services
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Advanced features work in isolation but may fail with real data
**Affected Areas**:
- ML recommendation display
- City search autocomplete
- Real-time route calculation
